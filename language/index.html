          <p>
            I was born in Italy so Italian is my native language but, I started studying English from primary school.
Knowing more than one language is a fundamental aspect today because more often people travel around the world for business or for pleasure.
Therefore, in middle school, I started spending some weeks during the summer to learn and practice English fluency attending colleges in the UK.

          <ul>
            <li>In September 2011, I studied at Bedales School, Certificate  available on request..</li>
            <li>In August 2012, I attended a college in Bath, Certificate available on request...</li>
            <li>In August 2013, I attended a school in Liverpool, Certificate available on request...</li>
            <li>In August 2015, I have been living in Wollongong with an Australian boy for almost a month for an exchange, Certificate available on request..</li>
            <li>Then In May 2016, I decided to take the First and the First Certificate in English (FCE) and I passed it with the overall score of 167, Certificate available on request...</li>
            <li>In August 2016, I have been to study in a college in Dublin, Certificate available on request...</li>
            <p>
              <br />Then since I wanted to meet the requirement for the application at the university, while I was doing the High School exam, between the second and the third test, I took the IELTS (according to the official website, the high stakes English test for international study, migration and work) and I passed it with an overall score of 7.<br />
            </p>
            <li>IELTS Certificate is available  on request..</li>
            <p>
              <br />All these certifications are a proof of my attitude and my availability at travelling that it is a necessary skill for an international career.<br />
