            In Computing, every software developer must have flexibility and adaptability as skills because since it is impossible to learn and know every existing programming language, the coder should be able to pass from a programming language to another with no difficulties.
            Since high school, I started to learn and study to use some software, IDE and tools just because they were some of my passions and hobbies.
            I am able to use some tools of the Adobe Creative Suite because I like editing photos and videos.
            I am able to use Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and After Effects.

            The book trailer I made in a High School teamwork is available on request..

            This year, I joined the NUCATS, society of computing and in their event, I learnt how to use Android studio and I also took part in a competition to win a Google home mini and I came in the second place.
