    <p>
      During this year at university, I have not only developed coding skills but also I have developed people skills and relationships with my colleague e.g. arranging meetings, make plans share ideas and coworking.
I have done some coursework with my colleagues, for example, we prepared a couple of presentation about historical facts of famous people in computing and programming languages.
Presentation skill is important for marketing if in need of presenting a product or for conferences. Knowing how to talk in public is also important to create relationships between people and to give the right motivation to your team.
Speaking is not the only skill required for interacting with other people, so this year I also practised academic writing.
This second semester I wrote a literature review about Human-Computer Interaction learning how to find good and right sources and combine the work that people have already done with the one researchers are still doing.

  The literature review is available only on request.
