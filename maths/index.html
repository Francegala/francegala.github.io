          <p>
            When choosing which secondary school to attend I decided on a high school specializing in scientific subjects to focus on mathematics, algebra and physics. In particular, I selected the IT stream that included computer-oriented problem solving.
            I successfully graduated from High School with a grade of 95/100 in which my Maths Exam result was of 14 out of 15.
            These results met my expectation so I could enter the Newcastle University that was my greatest ambition.
          </p>

          During the 5 years of High School, I learnt how to master time management skills and techniques to do my best with perfect timing and all the courses were problem solving based to give the students all the tools to face to every kind of problem.
          These skills are useful to face up to the university life indeed I have never submitted a piece of coursework late.
