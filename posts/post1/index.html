                  Technology surrounds us; we use mobile phones no more only as a tool to make calls, but it is part of our living. It helps us to connect on the internet, allowing us to carry on our pocket all the human knowledge. We can email, having videoconferences, chatting with friends and family even if we are far from them. Thinking about all the devices replaced by a simple app in your smartphone: satellite navigators replaced by google maps or Waze; emails and SMS by emails or all the free real-time chatting applications like WhatsApp, Facebook messenger or WeChat. <br /> <br />
                  I started early using a pc and the internet. My first Personal Computer ran basic Windows ’98 that I used to play with the first CD-ROM games. Then, at the age of twelve, I received my own All-In-One PC with Windows Vista, which I used for my first attempts at programming. I began with simple web-based programming, writing a few lines of code in the developing forums and then I started to create amusing websites in which I described my gaming experiences with friends. I started following some tutorials I could find online creating some browser games or simple RPG trying to learn and copy codes written by others. I enjoyed gaming so much that I decided to try to invent a personal game world through a simple drag and drop using RPG Maker. This software was straightforward and it offered me the chance to create something even advanced following the model of the early game boy Pokémon-like games. <br /> <br />
                  When I was thirteen years old, I began an extracurricular computer course at school. I was introduced to HTML programming from the basics to the creation of a web page, personalized with CSS and JavaScript. I started writing advanced code with the help of a tutor who taught me some shortcuts, some useful tricks and good practice which helped me with every program written from that day. I started becoming so passionate about software developer that I wanted to go further with my skills and then I started looking for a simple programming language to learn. I decided to go with Pascal even if it was harder than expected but still a good beginning. <br /> <br />
                  When choosing which secondary school to attend I decided on a high school specializing in scientific subjects to focus on mathematics, algebra and physics. I selected the IT stream that included computer-oriented problem-solving. I am very satisfied with my choice because I have found both the environment and syllabus challenging but rewarding. I was studying a C++ programming language and I have completed the European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) course. I learnt all the basics of programming such as loops, functions, variables, arrays, all the general programming notions. <br /> <br />
                  During the last two years of high schools, I had the chance to do a month-long internship at Red Frog Digital, a company based in Manchester and specialized in the development of Augmented Reality Applications. It was an excellent opportunity to discover the world of object-oriented programming, game design and development. It helped me studying advanced programming techniques and introduced me to app development. I understand the division of tasks and the level of teamwork that is necessary to create a high-quality finished product made up of numerous, all equally important, components from the animation to the code behind the game itself. During this period, I used Unity 3D exclusively and achieved an intermediate level of knowledge that encouraged me to follow several online courses on YouTube and other platforms such as Udemy. I tried to create and animate objects and characters before placing them in a first-person shooter game using the ray casting technique. At that moment, I decided that this would be my future, creating my own universe through several lines of code, a gaming utopia or dystopia. <br /> <br />
                  I chose to do my internship in the UK because this country has always fascinated me. I started to travel as a teenager, attending summer language courses in Bedales and Bath in 2011-12; I also followed a course at the Liverpool School of English some years ago. During my fourth year of high school, I took part in an exchange program, first hosting an Australian student in my home and then travelling to Wollongong NSW to attend the local college for a period of three weeks. This experience showed me different customs and traditions. I love travelling and studying, I feel cosmopolitan and that the world is my home. My most recent language course was in Dublin. <br /> <br />
                  I have had a positive high school career during which I have participated in many activities such as school open days, science Olympics, IT Olympics and theatre classes. I obtained the First Certificate in English in April 2016 and I am currently preparing the IELTS Academic certificate. I also passed the Diplôme d'études en Langue Française (DELF) certificate in French. I enjoy several hobbies including chess and playing the piano as well as sailing. I am keen on sci-fi series and in my spare time, I study software like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects and Sony Vegas Pro. <br /> <br />
                  Entering at Newcastle University has been one of my greatest achievement. I used a huge amount of time and energy for passing the IELTS exam to get the certification needed as a requirement and to achieve a 95/100 at my final high school exam. I decided to study for a computer science degree with Game Engineering, as I am interested in studying Game Development as it is a subject, I am passionate about and I envision my future career in this field, creating new technologies. I consider games to be a form of intergenerational entertainment that can also teach values like teamwork and fair play. <br /> <br />
