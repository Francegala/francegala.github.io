                          It is my first job. That is why I am a little bit concerned about how it will be joining a new environment, in a big company like Willis Towers Watson.

I already know something about what to expect as the contract defines so many aspects of my working days (e.g. code of conduct, dressing code, duties and working hours.)
I am so happy I succeeded in finding a placement as I have applied to many companies, done so many assessments, interviews, tests online, coding challenges, presentations and at the end, I met all the requirements for this American company.
Willis Towers Watson is a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth. It operates in more than 140 countries and has offices all around the world.
International economics and finance are topics that have always fascinated me. For that, I would be interested in studying some finance modules in my third year.
I have not travelled a lot around the UK. I have been only in some of the main big cities for assessment days or before starting the university in colleges for improving my fluency.
I have been to Ipswich only once, it is a quite nice city, small compared to Newcastle but at least it will be less cold. The company headquarters looks very modern; it is a large dark building made of reflective glass.
It will be a new experience, as I do not know many people from the south, so I have to make new friends as I did when I moved to the UK two years ago for studying at Newcastle University. Most of the people I know are from cities around Newcastle or will still be staying in Newcastle. I am not anxious too much about making new friends as for starting university I have left all my friendships in my home country, Italy. I am sure I will be fine starting from the beginning in Ipswich.
At the company, I will be an IT Engineer intern. I am looking forward to improving some skills I already master such as scripting, operating systems and networking skill using concepts like protocols from some of the main modules studied at university. I will also learn new skills such as incident and problem management, project and vendor management all related to servers and end-user computing within Willis Towers Watson.
